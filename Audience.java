 * This is a Java enumeration called Audience which represents the intended audience for a social media post.
 * The enumeration defines three possible values: GLOBAL, REGIONAL, and LOCAL.
 * The GLOBAL value could represent a post intended for a worldwide audience.
 * The REGIONAL value could represent a post intended for a specific region.
 * The LOCAL value could represent a post intended for a particular locality.
 * Using an enumeration like this can make code more readable and less error-prone,
 * because it ensures that only valid values are used for the intended purpose.
